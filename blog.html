                        <div class="blog-content">
                            <p>Today marks an exciting update to my portfolio site with the addition of several new projects and a complete design refresh of the projects section. These changes showcase my recent work while implementing improved visual hierarchy and UI components based on my design system guidelines.</p>
                            
                            <h4>New Projects Added</h4>
                            <p>I've expanded the portfolio with four additional projects that highlight different aspects of my technical expertise:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Wazzup News Aggregator API</strong> - A Laravel-powered API showcasing SOLID principles and design patterns</li>
                                <li><strong>Brief Markdowns for Gen AIs</strong> - A collection of standardized UI/UX reference documents for AI code generation</li>
                                <li><strong>Store with basic Cart features</strong> - A Laravel 12 e-commerce implementation with Stripe integration</li>
                                <li><strong>Accumulated HackMD Knowledge Base</strong> - A personal knowledge hub covering various technical topics</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Design System Implementation</h4>
                            <p>The redesign of the projects section provided an opportunity to better apply the principles from my <a href="https://github.com/jmrecodes/GenAI-UI-UX-Markdowns" title="Link to GenAI-UI-UX-Markdowns">Web Design System Brief</a>. The key improvements include:</p>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Enhanced Typography Hierarchy</strong> - Section headings now feature a consistent styling with an underline accent that creates visual interest while maintaining readability</li>
                                <li><strong>Card-Based Layout</strong> - Each project is displayed in a card with subtle shadows and hover effects that provide depth without overwhelming the content</li>
                                <li><strong>Refined Tag System</strong> - Technology tags now use pill-shaped elements with the site's color scheme for better visual distinction</li>
                                <li><strong>Interactive Elements</strong> - Project titles feature subtle underline animations on hover, improving user feedback and engagement</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Technical Implementation</h4>
                            <p>The redesign leveraged several modern CSS techniques:</p>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li>CSS Grid for responsive, automatically adjusting layouts</li>
                                <li>CSS custom properties (variables) to maintain consistent styling across components</li>
                                <li>CSS transitions for smooth hover interactions</li>
                                <li>Improved semantic HTML structure with appropriate header, article, and section elements</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Visual Consistency</h4>
                            <p>A key goal of this update was to maintain visual consistency throughout the site. By applying the section-heading class to all major headings and using consistent spacing patterns, the entire site now has a more cohesive feel. The project cards use the same color variables and border-radius values as other components, ensuring a unified design language.</p>

                            <h4>Enhanced Connectivity with Social Links</h4>
                            <p>In addition to the project updates, I've added social media links to the footer and a dedicated GitHub button in the header. These changes make it easier for visitors to connect with me across different platforms and explore my code repositories. The social links include profiles on:</p>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>GitHub</strong> - Where all my project repositories are hosted</li>
                                <li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - For professional networking</li>
                                <li><strong>HackerRank, LeetCode & freeCodeCamp</strong> - Showcasing my coding practice and problem-solving skills</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>The dedicated GitHub button in the navigation area provides instant access to my main code repository, emphasizing the importance of this platform in my development workflow. These social connections are designed with subtle hover animations and consistent styling that matches the site's overall aesthetic.</p>

                            <h4>What's Next?</h4>
                            <p>With these updates in place, I'm now looking ahead to further refining the portfolio. Future improvements might include:</p>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li>Adding detailed project case studies with development processes and outcomes</li>
                                <li>Implementing a dark mode toggle based on the existing color variables</li>
                                <li>Creating a filterable projects section to allow visitors to sort by technology or project type</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to enhance both the content and design of this portfolio!</p>

                        <div class="blog-content">
                            <p>Welcome to the very first post on my new portfolio site! It feels fitting that the inaugural article should be about the creation of this site itself â€“ a project built from the ground up using fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.</p>
                            
                            <h4>The Initial Spark & Requirements</h4>
                            <p>The goal was to create a clean, modern, and responsive online space to showcase my skills and projects. Key requirements included a design that could adapt its color theme from a logo, content driven by my resume, standard navigation (Home, Projects, Contact, Blog), a Google Maps integration for my location, and crucially, a structure that would be easy to maintain and potentially upgrade to a more dynamic backend or a JavaScript framework like Svelte or React in the future.</p>

                            <h4>Our Approach: Phased & Iterative with AI Collaboration</h4>
                            <p>We tackled this with a phased implementation. Working within the Cursor IDE, I leveraged its AI capabilities extensively. My AI assistant (Gemini!) helped generate boilerplate code, suggest modern design patterns, draft content like this very blog post, and rapidly iterate on CSS styles and JavaScript functionalities. This collaborative approach significantly sped up the development process and helped in exploring different solutions quickly. Starting with the basic HTML skeleton, we progressively layered on styling and functionality, allowing for focused development on each section.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Core Technologies & Design Philosophy</h4>
                            <p>Sticking to vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was a deliberate choice to demonstrate foundational skills. The design process was guided by the principles outlined in my <a href="https://github.com/jmrecodes/GenAI-UI-UX-Markdowns" title="Link to your GenAI-UI-UX-Markdowns">GenAI-UI-UX Design System Brief</a>, emphasizing simplicity, usability, and accessibility. The AI played a crucial role here too, by helping to translate these principles into concrete code and ensuring adherence to the brief. We aimed for a modern aesthetic with responsive layouts, dynamic elements like the sticky header with a logo swap on scroll, and a mobile-friendly hamburger menu.</p>

                            <h4>Key Features Implemented:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensuring the site looks and works great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using CSS media queries and flexible layouts (like CSS Grid and Flexbox).</li>
                                <li><strong>Dynamic Header:</strong> A sticky header that changes appearance and swaps the logo on scroll for a polished user experience.</li>
                                <li><strong>Modern Navigation:</strong> Smooth scrolling for on-page links, active link highlighting, and a responsive hamburger menu for smaller screens.</li>
                                <li><strong>Content Sections:</strong> Populating the Home, Projects, and Contact sections with relevant information and interactive elements like the Google Map.</li>
                                <li><strong>Future-Proofing:</strong> Using semantic HTML and modular CSS to make future updates or framework integrations smoother.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Challenges & Learnings</h4>
                            <p>One of the interesting parts was fine-tuning the Google Maps API integration, especially ensuring the API key was correctly activated and configured, and then migrating to the new <code>AdvancedMarkerElement</code>. Iteratively refining the CSS with AI suggestions to achieve the desired modern look and feel for elements like section titles and the skills layout was also a key part of the process. Each step was a learning opportunity!</p>

                            <h4>What's Next?</h4>
                            <p>This portfolio is a living project. I plan to add more projects, write more blog posts sharing insights and learnings, and perhaps even explore those future upgrades we planned for. For now, I'm excited to have this platform live. Thanks for reading!</p>
